Feature drift experiments repository

This repository contains a collection of open-source scipts, tools, and data for experiments on data and concept drift detectors.

DATA real - real-life datasets containing a concept drift.
DATA synthetic MOA - sample scripts for generating artifical datasets containing various types of concept drifts, using a MOA tool.
DATA synthetic - real-life datasets, which contain artifically introduced concept drifts.
Python - Python scripts for experimenting with various concept drift detectors.

The data and source codes deposited here can be downloaded and used without restrictions. However, the authors ask that references to these data in publications include the authors' publication:
